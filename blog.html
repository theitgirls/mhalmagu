        <h2>Day 2: What Are Teachable Machines?</h2>
        <p>Monica Almaguer / July 19, 2022</p>
        <p>
            A teachable machine is any technological machine that receives and analyzes data to learn. For example, Alexa, Siri, Google, social media, and many other applications analyze data to provide a more personal experience or to gain more intelligence of the world. The teachable machine that I created can differentiate between dogs, cats, and ferrets. By adding different photos of cats, ferrets, and dogs from the angel to the species, to the environment allows for random photos to be identified and not misidentified. I created this machine as a base for a more complicated idea. Take species of animal so from a photo the animal can be identified, and people donâ€™t have to spend time wondering what species of animal it is. By choosing photos of multiple animals in the same frame to confuse the machine and helps to make improvements in your program. I see a future with artificial intelligence being used in autonomous vehicles. AI is an important aspect of autonomous cars as it is constantly analyzing information and reading its surroundings to make decisions about what action is required to complete their task. I hope this is a helpful blog post!
