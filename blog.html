        <h2>Day 6: Are you Biased?</h2>
        <p>Monica Almaguer / July 25, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Bias is when someone favors one thing over the other because their perception of a certain topic in limited only to what they know. A bust is when another person tries to convince someone of their bias and fails. Today during the Bias and Bust activity we were given scenarios of how to convince people of different ages of different topic. For example: the earth is flat vs the earth is a sphere and stay for college/boyfriend or leave for college. We used pictures of a flat and round earth, articles about America and Australia, and statistics to prove decreased costs or relationship probability. We each took turns presenting our ideas or topics trying to persuade our speaker. Then we were given about 5 minutes to find resources to bust the other teamsâ€™ ideas. Bias in my opinion is very similar to debate except you are trying to convince someone using their biases and appealing to them by empathizing with their bias or ideas. This was a very fun and interactive activity!

        <h2>Day 5: Are you protected?</h2>
        <p>Monica Almguer / July 22, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is the protection over Personal Identifiable Information (PII). This includes social security, credit cards, bank accounts, identity, and anything considered personal private information. Michele used the following examples of threats:
            <ul>
                <li>Phishing</li>
                <li>Smishing</li>
                <li>Data Leaks</li>
                <li>Unsecured WiFi</li>
                <li>Password insecurity</li>
                <li>Open WiFi</li>
                <li>Insider Threats</li>
            </ul>
            These are threats people should be aware of so they can prevent falling victim to these ploys. There are many types of ways to prevent any type of hacking like virus or VPN protection for computers and databases. By taking the necessary precautions one can protect their PII. I think cyber security will continue to grow over time and evolve greatly. It is a very adaptive career field and it constantly improves due to hackers and viruses. I think as time goes on we will see more improvements in the field of cybersecurity.

        <h2>Day 4: Auroa Borealis</h2>
        <p>Monica Almaguer / July 21, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today my group studied Citizen Sciences. Citizen Science is when volunteers or day to day people help researchers analyze data on a topic. My group chose to analyze an ongoing project called Aurora Zoo. This is a study about aurora borealis or more popularly known as The Northern Lights. People who visit this website can help classify different shapes and help the current team of researchers. When people choose a shape that is similar to the short video clip provided it is helping the computer AI to identify and learn how to identify which shapes go with which image. This is a very fun and interesting website. The link is down below.

        <h2>Day 3: Scavenger Hunt(people edition)</h2>
        <p>Monica Almaguer / July 20, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today I had the opportunity to meet and speak with the Provost. Her name is Gretchen Ritter and she is not only the provost but also a professor. Not many people know who the Provost is or what they do. She overseas everything related to academics. For example: hiring faculty, promotions, support for research , student admissions, and curriculum. She communicates with the Deans of each school to stay up to date and respond to their requests. She greatly loves all the students and faculty and genuinely wants to see everyone succeed. They are constantly analyzing data to see how well something is working and being implemented. She uses email to communicate with other around campus and keep in touch with what is going on, on campus while she is away on business. She also uses technology to store and analyze data. This is a wonderful position, she has worked hard, and she is a very compassionate person.

            Also, as an overall lesson for today. No matter what you study to major in; you may go into an entirely different field. Its okay not to know what you want to do long term in high school. Give yourself time to explore and know what you want out of life. ðŸ˜Š

        <h2>Day 2: What Are Teachable Machines?</h2>
        <p>Monica Almaguer / July 19, 2022</p>
        <p>
            A teachable machine is any technological machine that receives and analyzes data to learn. For example, Alexa, Siri, Google, social media, and many other applications analyze data to provide a more personal experience or to gain more intelligence of the world. The teachable machine that I created can differentiate between dogs, cats, and ferrets. By adding different photos of cats, ferrets, and dogs from the angel to the species, to the environment allows for random photos to be identified and not misidentified. I created this machine as a base for a more complicated idea. Take species of animal so from a photo the animal can be identified, and people donâ€™t have to spend time wondering what species of animal it is. By choosing photos of multiple animals in the same frame to confuse the machine and helps to make improvements in your program. I see a future with artificial intelligence being used in autonomous vehicles. AI is an important aspect of autonomous cars as it is constantly analyzing information and reading its surroundings to make decisions about what action is required to complete their task. I hope this is a helpful blog post!

        <h2>Mary's Impact on Cryptology</h2>
        <p>Monica Almaguer / July 19, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Mary Louise Prather was born in Washington D.C. in 1913. Many personal and childhood details about her are unknown. She started working when she was 24 or 25 years old. She worked in the SIS as an entry level employee in 1938 and worked her way up the chain. She worked as an Administrative Assistant, Chief of the Stenographic section, personal officer for the General of the Cryptographic Branch, Chief of the Soviet Information Division, and Division Chief of the NSA. In 1960 she received her final promotion as Chief of The Soviet Information Division. She received the Commendation for Meritorious Civilian Service Award in 1946 for her decryption of two Japanese messages during WWII. In 1969 she retired and finished off her career as Division Chief of the NSA. She worked during World War II and beginning of the Cold War as a stenographer.
